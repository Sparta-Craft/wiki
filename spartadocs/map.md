Location coordinates displayed in the map's top left corner correspond with in-game coordinates displayed by pressing the F3 key. This information can be used to navigate in-game.

After joining the server, the first thing you need to do is find out where you spawned. Run command `/map` and get a clickable map link in chat. You can also visit the default map by clicking the link [map] Scroll to zoom in. You can access the map rendered in ISO mode in the right hand side menu.

The map is regularly updated to reflect changes made inside the game. The map shows:

- All visible online players.
- Changes made to the terrain.
- Claimed land belonging to nations and towns.
- Nation capitals.

Players underground, sneaking, or using invisibility potions are hidden from the map.

The colorful squares represent claimed land belonging to a town or nation. Click a claim of your choice to get more information about which town/nation it belongs to. [Premium] players can change their nation claim color via `/n set mapcolor [color]` or town claim `/t set mapcolor [color]`.
