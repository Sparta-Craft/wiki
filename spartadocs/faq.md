# Frequently Asked Questions
{: .fs-9 }

## Will you transfer data from an account to another account of mine?
No, sorry. We never transfer data or ranks between player accounts. This is mainly a question of security. The only way we can verify your identity is through your Minecraft account. Contact Mojang support if you have lost access to your account.

## How do I apply for helper?
You can apply at this <a TARGET="_BLANK" href="https://discord.gg/H9VNKH9tJC">link</a>. We wish you luck and hope to see you in the staff team.

## Can I join on Bedrock Edition?
This server only supports Minecraft Java Edition.

## Can I download the map?
No, the map is not downloadable by players. Nor the seed of the world.

## How long will it take for my order to arrive?
Payments usually arrive within approximately 30 minutes after purchase. If you do not receive the rank in 24 hours, please send us an <a href="mailto:contact@spartacraft.eu">email</a>.
