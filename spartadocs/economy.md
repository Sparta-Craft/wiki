# Economy
{: .fs-9 }

The currency on server is based on gold ingots. 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. The SpartaCraft economy is inflation resistant with efficient gold sinks. Gold is always in high demand which in turn creates a great gameplay experience and market environment. The large majority of items and services sold are provided by the players.

## Store your gold
The safest place for gold is in own bank. To deposit, run `/bank deposit [amount]` and for withdraw run `/bank withdraw [amount]`.

Gold can also be deposited into the virtual town/nation bank. This will allow residents with appropriate permissions to withdraw gold and use it for town/nation expenses such as claiming. To deposit, run `/t deposit [amount]` or `/n deposit [amount]`. With withdraw, run `/t withdraw [amount]` or `/n withdraw [amount]`.

## How to get gold
### Mining

The item-based currency allow players to dig it up straight from the ground. Gold ore is spread evenly across the world.

### Raiding

All town protections are removed when a town falls. Find abandoned towns and loot the riches. Stealing is allowed.

### Voting

Run the command `/vote` and click the provided link. You can vote right now by visiting the vote site <a TARGET="_BLANK" href="https://shorturl.at/fKPW1">here</a>. You will receive a random award of up to 64 gold ingots after successfully voting for the server. Keep in mind that you are able to vote without being online. Your award will be given to you next time you sign in.

### Shops

Open a shop and sell items to other players. The only thing you need is stock, competitive pricing, and a good location. Hit a chest with the item you want to sell and follow the instructions. The most successful shops are built in capitals. Capitals have the benefit of attracting a lot of customers through the nation spawn. The shopping districts of capitals are usually one of the main sources of income for nations and players alike.
