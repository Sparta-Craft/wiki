# Trades
{: .fs-9 }

To avoid scams between trades we have implemented the command `/trade [player]` but they have to be 50 blocks away from the other player. You can accept or deny a trade request with command `/trade accept` or `/trade deny`. You can also disable trade requests running `/trade toggle`.
