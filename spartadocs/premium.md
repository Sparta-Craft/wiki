# Premium
{: .fs-9 }

<a TARGET="_BLANK" href="https://store.spartacraft.eu">Here is the store page</a> if you're interested in purchasing premium.

Premium is a paid rank designed to contribute to the server's funding and development, ensuring that thousands of players can enjoy the server for free. At SpartaCraft, we firmly believe in a fair gaming experience where players cannot pay for progress, setting us apart from most other servers. Gold, the server's currency, exclusively supports all aspects of progress within the server, making it impossible to purchase gold with real money. Instead, we offer convenience to those who choose to support the server through premium. Enjoy numerous convenient features that can enhance your SpartaCraft experience with premium.

## Premium features

### Longer view distance
Long view distance is resource heavy and therefore exclusive to premium. The actual view distance range can sometimes vary depending on server load, but is always at least 4 chunks more than what normal players have.

### Double ender chest space
Premium will give you access to a “large ender chest” which means your ender chest storage gets doubled. If your premium runs out, excess items will be moved to your inventory.

### Change territory color
Nation kings can change their map territory color from the default color.Color options support different colors such as blue, yellow, red, green etc...

### Powerful cosmetics
Gold username in chat, ability to change chat name, firework on join, join full server, tab list priority and ability to use any item as hat.
